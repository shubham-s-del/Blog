title: Get to know me just a little bit more...
---

I am a tech enthusiast (other people sometimes refer to this as a geek), and hope to be closely involved with engineering / tech-entrepreneurship for the years to come.

Currently, I am upskilling my profile with additional computer science and business knowledge through a graduate degree in Information Systems from New York University. At NYU, I seek to establish greater expertise in the field of scalable distributed systems, machine learning, and Artificial Intelligence. For my entrepreneurial ambitions, I also seek to acquire an understanding of Finance, Managerial Economics, Strategy, Entrepreneurship, and Emerging Technologies.

Previously, I was a Software Development professional with 5.5+ years of exposure in Indiaâ€™s leading online retail company - Flipkart -  where I leveraged competency in distributed systems, service-oriented architecture, and Java backend development to develop, optimize, manage and support gateway routing API platform, user-session management platform, audit data management platform, user-experience API definitions, A/B platform and reverse-geocoding system.
